# Dollars and Sense
App to help teach kids to manage their money.

This is a personal project to help my kids manage their money, but to also allow me to experiment with different technologies and coding languages.

- Goal 1: Implement the REST APIs in .NET, GO, Rust, and maybe some others as I have time and technologies change. 
- Goal 2: Implement the front-end in Angular, React, Vue and maybe some others as technologies change.
- Goal 3: Make it easy to choose different data stores, by just implementing a new repository.
- Stretch Goal: Supporting Android and Apple Apps

This is my playground expect it to be sandy and unorganized at times.
